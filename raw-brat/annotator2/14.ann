T1	PrimaryOutcome 44 72	time to clinical improvement
T2	TimeFrame 73 107	within 28 days after randomisation
T3	OutcomeDefinition 145 284	a two-point reduction in patients' admission status on a six-point ordinal scale, or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first
R1	DefinedAs Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3	
T4	OutcomeDefinition 286 912	The six-point scale was as follows: death=6; hospital admission for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation=5; hospital admission for non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy=4; hospital admission for oxygen therapy (but not requiring high-flow or non-invasive ventilation)=3; hospital admission but not requiring oxygen therapy=2; and discharged or having reached discharge criteria (defined as clinical recoveryâ€”ie, normalisation of pyrexia, respiratory rate <24 breaths per minute, saturation of peripheral oxygen >94% on room air, and relief of cough, all maintained for at least 72 h)=1.
