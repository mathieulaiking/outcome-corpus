 Outcomes

The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary endpoints included early mortality (Days 7 and 14), the need for orotracheal intubation by Day 7, and the proportion of patients with an oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) < 100 by Day 7. Post hoc exploratory analyses were for mortality rates in subgroups (whether enrolled already in IMV or not, age, and some laboratorial predictors of severity). Subgroup analyses were based on the same direction of prespecified hypotheses (benefit of MP), consistency across other studies, and a strong preexisting biological rationale supporting the apparent subgroup effect [18]. We also analyzed the length of hospitalization, the radiological presence of fibrosis or Bronchiolitis Obliterans with Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP) after Day 7 [19], a need for insulin or an increase in the dosage in diabetic patients, a positive blood culture (Bactec), and the presence of viral RNA in the naso-/oropharyngeal swab at Day 7. As per protocol, the Day 120 visit will focus on the respiratory sequelae of surviving patients; therefore, those data will not be presented here.
