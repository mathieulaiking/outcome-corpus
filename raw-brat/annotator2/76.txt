Outcomes
Time to clinical improvement was considered as primary outcome of study. Clinical improvement was defined as improvement of at least two points from the baseline status on the six-category ordinal scale [18]. This scale contains the subsequent categories: (1) death (2) hospital admission requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (3) hospital admission, requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (4) hospital admission, requiring oxygen (5) hospital admission, not requiring oxygen (6) discharge. Secondary outcomes were clinical status of patients at day 7, 14 and 28, ICU admission and intubation rates, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, and 28-day mortality.
Side effects related to IFN therapy and other adverse events during the study period were monitored and recorded as the safety outcomes.
Categorization of adverse events was done according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE), National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute, 2017.
Also serious complications during the hospitalization course such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), nosocomial infections, septic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute hepatic injury (AHI) were considered.
