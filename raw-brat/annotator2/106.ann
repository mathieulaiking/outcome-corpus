T1	PrimaryOutcome 59 87	time to clinical improvement
T2	OutcomeDefinition 100 147	the days from randomization until normalization
T3	OutcomeDefinition 149 951	Clinical improvement was assessed by five components including body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, alleviation of cough, and absorption of pulmonary infection by chest CT. Normalization was defined as body temperature < 37.0 °C, respiratory rate < 24 times per minute indoors, and oxygen saturation > 94% (fingertip). Alleviation of cough was defined as a reduced severity of cough from a physician-reported scale of severe or moderate to mild condition or absence. Absorption of pulmonary infection was defined as an absorption area > 2/3 by Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images on chest CT. Alleviation of these five clinical symptoms were required to stay normal for at least 72 h on all components to fulfill the primary endpoint of clinical improvement.
