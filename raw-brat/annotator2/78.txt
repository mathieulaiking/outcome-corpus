 Outcome Measures
The primary efficacy outcome was clinical status assessed on a 7-category ordinal scale (1, discharged or ready for discharge; 2, non–intensive care unit [ICU] hospital ward, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 3, non–ICU hospital ward, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, ICU or non–ICU hospital ward, requiring noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen; 5, ICU, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation; 6, ICU, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation and additional organ support; 7, death) at day 28. Clinical status was recorded at baseline and every day during hospitalization. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were clinical status at day 14 on the 7-category ordinal scale, mortality at day 28, ventilator-free days to day 28, time to improvement from baseline in ≥2 categories on the 7-category ordinal scale, and time to hospital discharge (or ready for discharge [defined as normal body temperature and respiratory rate and stable oxygen saturation on ambient air or ≤2 L supplemental oxygen]). Other secondary endpoints included time to clinical failure defined as death, withdrawal during hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, or ICU transfer (for patients intubated or in the ICU at baseline, a 1-category worsening of clinical status was considered clinical failure); incidence of mechanical ventilation (among those not mechanically ventilated at randomization); incidence of ICU transfer (among those not in ICUs at baseline); and duration of ICU stay. Adverse events were recorded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system organ class and preferred term.
