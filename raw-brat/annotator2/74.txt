 Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was ventilator-free days during the first 28 days, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 28 days, clinical status of patients at day 15 using a 6-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1, not hospitalized to 6, death), ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (range, 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater organ dysfunction) at 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days.


Outcomes

The primary outcome was ventilator-free days during the first 28 days, defined as the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation for at least 48 consecutive hours.20 Patients discharged from the hospital before 28 days were considered alive and free from mechanical ventilation at 28 days. Nonsurvivors at day 28 were considered to have no ventilator-free days. More details on the definitions are provided in the eMethods section of Supplement 3.

Prespecified secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality during 28 days, clinical status of patients at day 15 using a 6-point ordinal scale adapted from the World Health Organization R&D Blueprint expert group21â€”(1) not hospitalized, (2) hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, (3) hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen, (4) hospitalized, requiring noninvasive ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, (5) hospitalized, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO, and (6) death; ICU-free days during the first 28 days; mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days; and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, which range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction, at 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days. For post hoc analyses, we evaluated the components of ventilator-free days during the first 28 days, the cumulative proportions of the 6-point ordinal scale at 15 days, and the outcome of discharge from hospital alive within 28 days. For patients who died, the number of ventilator-free days was 0; for patients who were alive, the ventilator-free days were the days they did not require mechanical ventilation.
