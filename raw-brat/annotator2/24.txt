 Outcomes

The primary efficacy end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization (D0) to an improvement of 2 points on a 7-category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital (Dend), and improvement rate of follow-up CT scans at D14. The 7-category ordinal scale has been used in other COVID-19 randomized controlled trials31 and also recommended by the World Health Organization R&D Blueprint expert group32 (see this article’s Methods section in the Online Repository). Other clinical outcomes included clinical improvement rate as assessed with the 7-category ordinal scale on D7, D14, D21, and D28, time from randomization to lymphocyte recovery and to invasive mechanical ventilation, the duration of hospitalization in survivors, and the time from treatment initiation to death and virus clearance time. The primary safety end point was the incidence of serious adverse events occurring up to 28 days. Safety outcomes included adverse events and serious adverse events that occurred during treatment. Particularly, the eventual negative impact of ruxolitinib on SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance and its specific IgM and/or IgG-antibody formation and/or lymphocyte recovery was also included in the safety profile. Lymphopenia was defined as peripheral absolute lymphocytes less than 1.0 × 109/L. Lymphocyte recovery time was defined as the first day at which lymphocytes returned to the normal levels within the observation period. The virus clearance time was defined as the time from randomization to the first day of at least 2 consecutive negative RT-PCR assays separated by 24 hours apart. The secondary end point is the overall mortality at D28. The investigational outcomes included the dynamic changes in the virus copies, cytokine profile, SARS-CoV-2–speicific antibody, and its correlation with clinical treatment response.
