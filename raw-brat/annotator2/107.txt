 Primary clinical outcome
There was a significant difference in the 28-day mortality, no patient died (0%) in the treatment group, while five patients died (12.8%) in the standard group; P= 0.027 (Fig. 3). Among patients in the treatment arm with bromhexine, two patients were admitted to ICU (5.1%) while in the standard arm, eleven patients (28.2%) were transferred to ICU. There was a significant difference in the ICU admission between the treatment and the standard group (P = 0.006). Moreover, among patients in bromhexine arm, one patient received mechanical ventilation (2.6%), while in the standard arm nine patients (23.1%) were intubated and underwent mechanical ventilation. There was also a highly significant difference in the intubation and mechanical ventilation between the two groups (P = 0.007) as shown in Table 2.
Secondary clinical outcomes
There was also a significant difference in the secondary outcome of this study (Fig. 4). Improvement of cardinal respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnea within two weeks among the two groups were assessed:
Dyspnea remained in 3.4% in the treatment group vs 48.3% in the standard group P ≤ 0.001 and cough remained in the treatment group 6.9% vs 40.0% in the standard group, P = 0.003). Similar results for lassitude between the two groups were observed (6.9% vs 34.5%, P = 0.010). At baseline, there was no significant difference in the frequency of fever, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms between the two groups.
The patients in the bromhexine group showed improvement in the level of LDH (363.2±83.6 vs. 445.3±115.2; P = 0.056), NLR [1.7 (1.0) vs. 3.0 (6.3); P=0.052] and CRP [0% vs. 81.8%; P < 0.001)] within two weeks compared to the standard group (Table 2).
There was no significant difference in the length of stay in the hospital [from randomization to discharge] between the two groups (treatment 7.6±3.5 days and standard 8.1±5.5 days; P = 0.587).
