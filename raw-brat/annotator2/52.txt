 Abstract
Background. Interventions mitigating progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID 19 would markedly improve outcome and reduce healthcare utilization. We hypothesized that immunomodulation with IVIG would improve oxygenation and reduce length of hospital stay and progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID 19 pneumonia.
Methods. Patients with COVID 19 were randomized 1:1 to prospectively receive standard of care (SOC) plus IVIG 0.5 g/kg/day x 3 days with methylprednisolone 40 mg 30 minutes before infusion versus SOC alone.

Clinical data extraction and analysis. Relevant clinical and laboratory information was captured to allow for group comparisons, including the calculation of Charlson comorbidity index (https://www.mdcalc.com/charlson comorbidity index cci) and APACHE II acute illness severity score (https://www.mdcalc.com/apache ii score#next steps). The alveolar arterial (A a) gradient was calculated (https://www.mdcalc.com/a a o2 gradient) for each subject at the time of enrollment based on arterial blood gases when available or based on PaO2 extrapolated SpO2 and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Interleukin 6 was measured from blood 24 48 hours after enrollment (https://ltd.aruplab.com/Tests/Pub/0051537).

Clinical outcomes. The two patient groups were well matched with respect to their
Charlson comorbidity index and severity of illness APACHE 2 scores (Figure 2). Median
Charlson index was 2 for both groups. Median APACHE 2 score was 7 for SOC and 7.5 the IVIG study group. Figure 2 demonstrates the subjects in the control SOC and treatment IVIG group that developed a need for mechanical ventilation after study enrollment, denoted as the red data points. An overall trend is for receipt of mechanical ventilation in the IVIG group in the 2 patients with highest comorbidity and illness severity scores, whereas in the SOC group mechanical ventilation requirement developed across the entire spectrum of scores.
Among the entire enrolled and evaluated subjects in each arm, 2 patients in the IVIG arm and 7 patients in the control SOC arm developed a need for mechanical ventilation.
Among these 7 SOC patients, 6 received ventilation and 1 was made a ‘do not intubate’ and the patient expired within 24 hours. The difference in receipt of mechanical ventilation was not statistically significant between the two groups (p=0.12, Fisher exact test). Among subjects whose respiratory failure progressed to the need for mechanical ventilation, 1 of 2 IVIG subjects and 2 of 3 control subjects also received concomitant convalescent plasma. Concomitant glucocorticoid therapy was given to 5 of the 7 control subjects who progressed to mechanical ventilation.

This resulted in 1 of 2 IVIG patients and 3 of 7 SOC subjects that required ventilation receiving remdesivir.
Alveolar arterial (A a) gradients were calculated directly from arterial blood gas or estimated based on PaO2 and FiO2 measurement. Based on an increase in APACHE II severity of illness scoring associated with achieving and A a gradient of > 200 mm Hg (+2 points), subjects were stratified into those with A a gradient < 200 mm Hg or >200 mm Hg, corresponding to a PaO2/FiO2 of <140, or the approximate requirement of 6 liters O2 by nasal cannula for a PaO2 of <92%. As shown in Figure 3A, none of the 7 subjects (5 SOC, 2 IVIG) with A a gradient < 200 mm Hg progressed to mechanical ventilation, but for subjects with A a gradient of > 200 mm Hg at enrollment, the progression to mechanical ventilation was 7/12 (58%) in the SOC control arm vs 2/14 (14%) in the IVIG, a difference that was statistically significant (p=0.038, Fisher Exact test).
Evaluation of overall hospital course, including length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay also was highly dependent on A a gradient stratification. Among the 7 patients with A a gradient < 200 mm Hg, no patient required ICU stay during their illness and length of hospital stay were 3 8 days. However, for the subjects with A a gradient > 200 at enrollment, median length of hospital stay was 19 (range 4 30) and 11 (range 5 22) days for SOC and IVIG groups, respectively (p=0.013, Mann Whitney U test, Figure 3B).
Median ICU stay were 12.5 days (range 1 29) and 2.5 days (range 0 16) for SOC and IVIG, respectively (p=0.006, Mann Whitney U test, Figure 3C).

The supplementary Figure shows schematically the hospital stays from the time of admission of the 33 enrolled patients with respect to medical floor and ICU stays with and without mechanical ventilation.
Improvement in oxygenation was evaluated by examining the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at the day of enrollment and 7 days after enrollment in individual subjects for SOC (Figure 4A) and IVIG (Figure 4B). Differences in day 7 PaO2/FiO2 minus enrollment PaO2/FiO2 are shown in Figure 4C for both groups, with negative numbers representing worsening in oxygenation. Among the entire subject population, median improvement PaO2/FiO2 for IVIG was +153 (range +35 to + 330) and was better than SOC +90 (range 115 to
+280), but did not reach statistical significance (p=0·057, Mann Whitney U test).
However, when refocusing on the higher risk patients with A a gradient >200 at enrollment, median improvement of PaO2/FiO2 for IVIG was significantly greater than SOC, with median (range) of +131 (+35 to +330) versus +44·5 ( 115 to +157) (p=0·01,
Mann Whitney U test).
Figure 4C denotes subjects in the SOC group who did not receive any glucocorticoid therapy as red data points. Seven subjects in SOC did not receive glucocorticoids, 4 of whom were in the low risk group with A a gradient < 200. Of the remaining 3 patients, 2 progressed to requiring mechanical ventilation, one of which was made do not intubate and died. PaO2/FiO2 changes between enrollment and day 7 of the 10 SOC patients who received glucocorticoid therapy (median 11 days) was median +53 (range 115 to
+216), a difference that remained significantly lower than the IVIG group (p=0.0057,
Mann Whiney U test). .CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)
