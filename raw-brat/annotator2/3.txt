Outcomes
The primary outcome was the rate of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from the initiation of treatment to day 21, with the enrollment day as the first day of treatment. The secondary outcomes were: 1) the rate of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid at day 14; 2) the rate of antipyresis (defined as axillary temperature ≤37.3°C for more than 72 hours) from the first day of treatment; 3) the rate of cough alleviation from initiation; 4) the improvement rate of chest CT at days 7 and 14; 5) the deterioration rate of clinical status from mild/moderate to severe/critical status during the study period. The severe status was defined as meeting any of the following criteria: experiencing respiratory distress, RR≥30 times/minute; oxygen saturation ≤93% in the resting state; arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2) ≤300 mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa).5 The critical status was defined as meeting any of the following criteria: development of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; occurrence of shock; requirement for ICU monitoring and treatment because of complications with other organ failures.5
Specimens from pharyngeal swabs were tested every 2 to 3 days. Negative conversion of nucleic acid was defined as negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid for two consecutive instances separated by more than 24 hours.
Criteria of chest CT improvement included: 1) no new exudative lesions; 2) decreasing size of exudative lesions; 3) decreasing densities of lesions.
All participants were monitored for adverse events. Safety outcomes were assessed from serious adverse event reports. Any unexpected medical occurrence resulting in death, prolonged hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, which was judged to be causally related to the study intervention, would be reported as a serious adverse event to the
Institutional Review Board. Potential adverse events for the study were defined as follows (1) anaphylaxis; (2) elevation of ALT or AST to more than 2.5-fold the upper normal limit or elevation of TBIL to more than 1.5-fold the upper normal limit; (3) acute pancreatitis; and (4) diarrhea.
