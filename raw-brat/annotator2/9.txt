Main Outcomes and Measures  Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4.


Outcomes

Safety outcomes included adverse events that occurred during treatment, serious adverse events, and premature or temporary discontinuation of treatment. Adverse events were classified according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The working hypothesis of this trial was that the lethality rate in the high-dosage group would be half that of the low-dosage group by day 28. Thus, the primary end point was lethality by day 28. Secondary end points included lethality on day 13, participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, electrocardiogram on days 13 and 28, daily clinical status during hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation (if applicable) and supplementary oxygen (if applicable), and the time (in days) from treatment initiation to death. Here we present analyses until day 13, with lethality as the primary outcome. A subgroup of patients enrolled when already admitted to the intensive care unit was analyzed separately. Virologic measures included viral RNA detection on days 0 and 4.
