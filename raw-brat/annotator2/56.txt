Outcomes

The primary outcome was the difference in the interval from baseline (initiation of antiviral treatment) to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity by nasopharyngeal swab among the three antiviral treatment groups, with each of these two tests at least 24 h apart. The secondary outcomes included the differences among the three groups in the proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity at day 14, the mortality rate at day 28, the proportion of patients re-classified as severe cases during the study period, the incidence of adverse events during the study period, and the proportion of therapeutic discontinuations due to adverse events during the study period.  SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity was defined as the presence of negative SARS-COV-2 results in at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with an interval of at least 24 h between the two time points of swab-taking. Of the two consecutive negative RT-PCR test results, the first negative result was used to calculate the interval between baseline and SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid negativity.
