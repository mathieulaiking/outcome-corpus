 Outcomes

The primary outcome measurement for this study was time to clinical recovery (TTCR), defined as the number of days from randomization to clinical recovery. Maximum TTCR was 28 days. Patients were considered to have achieved clinical recovery when they had met all of the following criteria for at least 48 hours: 1. axillary body temperature ≤36.9°C or oral body temperature ≤37.2°C; 2. complete relief of all symptoms other than cough; 3. cough graded as mild or absent on a patient-reported scale of severe, moderate, mild, absent.

Secondary outcome measurements included (up to 28 days): 1. time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA negativity, defined as the time from randomization to the day of the first test in two consecutive tests of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs with negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA; 2. length of hospital stay, defined as the number of days from randomization to discharge; 3. Changes on chest CT scan; 4. duration (days) of supplemental oxygenation; 5. frequency of adverse events; 6. clinical status; 7. all-cause mortality; 8. duration (days) of supplemental oxygenation; 9. vital signs; 10. results of laboratory testing.

We used a semi-quantitative scoring system similar to the method reported by Pan et al. to estimate the pulmonary manifestations on CT scan [16]. The five lobes of the lungs were assigned a total score of 20 points, based on the volume of tissue affected. The score was given based on the overall affected areas of each side of the lung. Every 10% of affected areas from each lung can be recorded 1 point. Changes in cytokine levels and COVID-19-specific IgG/IgM levels were measured during the first week of hospitalization.
