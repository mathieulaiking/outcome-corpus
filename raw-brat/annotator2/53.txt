 Outcomes assessment: The primary outcomes included virological and clinical evaluations.
Time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA negativization (absence of the virus according to the RT-PCR) in positive patients after starting antiviral therapy was the virological endpoint. It was expressed as the percentage of patients negative to SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in throat exudate tissue calculated at 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours. Days to reach the viral negativization were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier plots and compared with a Log-rank test. Hazard Ratio with 95% CI of ratio was also calculated.
The clinical evaluation considered the time to progression to severe COVID-19 and it was calculated by the percentage of patients who became severely ill after the end of the antiviral treatment under investigation.
