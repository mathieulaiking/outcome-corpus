A 4.5 mm fibreoptic bronchoscope (UE Medical Company Ltd, Zhejiang, China) loaded with a lubricated reinforced Parker Flex-TipÂ® tracheal tube (Well Lead Medical Company Ltd., Guangzhou, China) was inserted until the carina was visualised, and the tube was advanced over the bronchoscope into the trachea. During attempts at tracheal intubation, HFNO was maintained for the HFNO group, whereas no oxygen was administered for the SMO group. After removal of the bronchoscope, successful intubation was confirmed by capnography. If Spo2 <90% occurred during intubation, bronchoscopy was terminated and face-mask ventilation was initiated to correct desaturation. The primary endpoint was the total time of intubation, defined as the sum of the time spent from the beginning of bronchoscopy until proper tracheal tube placement was confirmed. The secondary endpoints included the lowest Spo2 during intubation, incidence of mask ventilation for Spo2 <90%, Pao2/Fio2 before intubation, incidence of Spo2 <80% during intubation, incidence of minimum Spo2 >95% during intubation, and 7 day mortality.
