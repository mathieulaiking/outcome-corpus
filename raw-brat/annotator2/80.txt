Outcomes
The primary end point was the cure rate of the enrolled patients. The definition for cure followed the standard given by the “Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (5th or update version)” as 1) fever attenuated for continuously 7 days, 2) twice COVD-19 nucleolus acid detections negative, 3) CT scan shows chest effusion absorbed more than 50% percent when the patient is discharged from hospital. Secondary outcomes were the recovery rate of hypoxia over 14 days, the worsening rate of hypoxia during hospitalization, the duration of hospital stay, and the time to negative virus load. Hypoxia was defined as when inhaling room air, the peripheral oxygen saturation was less than 93%. Hypoxia recovery was defined as the patient's fingertip oxygen saturation was ≥ 93% when inhaling room air. Hypoxia worsening is defined as the patient's inhaling oxygen concentration must be upregulated so as to maintain normal oxygen saturation levels. Safety outcomes included treatment -emergent adverse events, serious adverse events.
