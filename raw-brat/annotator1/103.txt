Outcomes

The primary outcome was the cumulative lung lesion remission rate (lung CT examination indicated absorption of lung inflammation). Secondary outcomes were the improvement of clinical symptoms (cough, diarrhea, dyspnea, fever, myalgia) before and after treatment; the changes of blood routine test and IL-6; changes of oxygen therapy. In addition, we also analyzed the peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets (count and proportion) before and after treatment. Safety endpoints were the frequencies of adverse events in each group.
