T8	PrimaryOutcome 822 885	change from the baseline in the patient overall self-assessment
T9	OutcomeDefinition 915 1853	response to the question: Considering all the ways in which illness and health conditions may affect you at this time, please indicate below how you are doing? The response options were measured on the 0–10 VAS, from ‘very well’ (score of 0) to ‘very poorly’ (score of 10). That question is validated in the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), which is a pooled index of the three patient-reported Core Data Set measures of the American College of Rheumatology, and it has previously been used to determine the activity of autoimmune diseases, degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis (18), and infectious diseases with a strong component of general malaise, such as chikungunya fever (37). That end point is similar to the symptom severity score (self-assessed using a 10-point VAS) recently used in a clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [38].

T10	SecondaryOutcome 1883 2092	changes from the baseline in different types of body pain (arthralgia, myalgia, headache, and sore throat), or more exactly, the difference between the values at enrollment and on days 3, 5, and 7 of follow-up
T11	OutcomeDefinition 2094 2687	Pain was measured on the 0–10 VAS (27). Intensity of pain was recorded, from ‘no pain’ (score of 0) to ‘worst imaginable pain’ (score of 10). The VAS was selected because it is the validated scale that best evaluates pain in diseases (28,29), at present, and because it has also been used as a primary endpoint in other clinical trials (30). Patients completed the previously validated fatigue VAS (0–10 scale) [37], which states: “How much of a problem has unusual fatigue or tiredness been for you today” and was anchored from 0 (fatigue is not a problem) to 10 (fatigue is a major problem).
