Primary and exploratory efficacy end points

The dynamic conversion from positive to negative of SARS-Cov2 RT-PCR results was analyzed in both groups of treatments at 0, 3, 7, and 14 days. No significant differences were observed in the median time, 11 days ± 8.0 for CIGB-325 plus standard care and 12 days ± 6 for standard care alone (p = 0.614). Thus, time to SARS-Cov2 viral clearance in the nasopharynx swabs behaved similarly for both treatments over the time.
The clinical status was classified in categories of asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe disease and it was followed up until ending treatment and thereafter for both groups. In the intent-to-treat population of CIGB-325 group at day 6 there were 2/10 patients that remained asymptomatic since initiation of treatment, 2/10 changed from severe to moderate, 1/10 from moderate to asymptomatic, 1/10 from mild to asymptomatic and 4/10 did not change their clinical status during the treatment. Otherwise, in the control 6/10 patients remained asymptomatic since initiation of treatment, 1/10 changed from mild to asymptomatic and 3/10 did not change their clinical status during the treatment. Additionally, chest-CT analysis was performed to investigate the effect of CIGB-325 over the Covid-19 pulmonary lesions. For that purpose, both number and lesion’s extent at day 0 and after treatment (day 7) were compared just in those patients analyzed per protocol (Table 1). Importantly, CIGB-325 treatment significantly reduced the median number of pulmonary lesions from 9.5 ± 10 (day 0) to 5.5 ± 10 (day 7) (p = 0.042). Conversely, no substantial change was observed in the control group. Proportion of patients with reduction of pulmonary lesions was higher in the CIGB-325 group compared with control according to the Bayesian analysis (pDif > 0; 0.951) (Table 1).
The effect over lesion’s extent showed in Supp. 2 including those patients analyzed per protocol indicates that CIGB-325 treatment also reduced the median of lesion’s extent after consecutive-5 day regimen although not significantly. Otherwise, any kind of reduction was observed in the control group. Importantly, proportion of patients with reduction of lesion’s extent was higher in the CIGB-325 group (4/7) compared with control (1/9) (pDif > 0; 0.982) (Bayesian analysis).
The overall chest-CT response was also analyzed considering the lesion’s extent and the pattern of Covid-19 typical chest-CT abnormalities (Supp. 3). The analysis per protocol showed that 50% (3/6) of patients in the CIGB-325 group had a favorable overall chest-CT response compared with 28.6% (2/7) in the control (pDif > 0; 0.796) (Bayesian analysis). Importantly, any patient had progression in the CIGB-325 group and 28.6% (2/7) in the control group did it. Representative images of chest-CT evolution from one CIGB-325 treated patient are shown in Fig. 2.

We also investigated the levels of Creatinine Phospho Kinase (CPK), Reactive C-Protein (RCP), and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in plasma. Of note, data from Supp. 4 shows that CIGB-325 treatment significantly reduced the CPK (p = 0.007) and LDH (p = 0.028) serum levels. Also, the RCP values were lowered by CIGB-325 although with no statistical difference.
