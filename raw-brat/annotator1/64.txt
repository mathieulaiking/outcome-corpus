 Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary end point was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care group.


End Points

The primary efficacy end point was the distribution of clinical status assessed on the 7-point ordinal scale on study day 11. If remdesivir treatment improves outcomes, the distribution of scores among patients who received remdesivir should shift more toward the higher values of the scale than the distribution of scores among patients who received standard care.

The secondary end point was the proportion of patients with adverse events throughout the duration of the study. Prespecified exploratory end points were (1) time to recovery (improvement from a baseline score of 2-5 to a score of 6 or 7 or from a baseline score of 6 to a score of 7); (2) time to modified recovery (improvement from a baseline score of 2-4 to a score of 5-7, improvement from a baseline score of 5 to a score of 6-7, or improvement from a baseline score of 6 to a score of 7); (3) time to clinical improvement (â‰¥2-point improvement from baseline on the 7-point ordinal scale); (4) time to 1-point or larger improvement; and (5) time to discontinuation of any oxygen support. The proportion of patients with these end points was also assessed on days 5, 7, and 11. Other exploratory end points were duration of hospitalization, duration of different modes of respiratory support, and all-cause mortality. Due to logistical issues at the time of study implementation, virological and pharmacokinetic measurements were limited, including SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests on day 5 and day 10, and are not presented.
