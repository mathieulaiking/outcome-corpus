 Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary end point was organ support–free days (days alive and free of ICU-based respiratory or cardiovascular support) within 21 days, where patients who died were assigned –1 day. The primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model that included all patients enrolled with severe COVID-19, adjusting for age, sex, site, region, time, assignment to interventions within other domains, and domain and intervention eligibility. Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority >99%).


Outcomes

The primary outcome was respiratory and cardiovascular organ support–free days up to day 21, an ordinal end point with death within the hospital as the worst outcome (labeled –1), then the length of time free of both respiratory and cardiovascular organ support, such that the best outcome would be 21 organ support–free days. Organ support was defined using the same criteria as those for study entry. This outcome was used in a recent registration trial in septic shock approved by the Food and Drug Administration (although up to 28 days), with a 1.5-day difference (7.5%-15% relative difference) considered to be the minimal clinically important difference.18

Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, respiratory support–free days, cardiovascular organ support–free days, a composite outcome of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or death among those not ventilated at baseline, and the WHO ordinal scale (range, 0-8, where 0 = no illness, 1-7 = increasing level of care, and 8 = death) assessed at day 14.19,20 This scale was used in a recent COVID-19 RCT of remdesivir, where an odds ratio of 1.32 was considered clinically important, although few data support that assumption.20
