 Outcomes
Reductions of C reactive protein levels at day 5 and 8 after randomization were chosen as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included admission to ICU within 15 and 30 days from randomization, occurrence of mechanical ventilation within 15 and 30 days from randomization, death within 15 and 30 days from randomization, composite occurrence of admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation or death within 15 and 30 days from randomization, proportion of patients requiring supplemental oxygen at day 15 (or with an oxygen saturation lower than 96% while breathing room air), time from randomization to discharge up to day 15 from randomization, and significative differences in serum lactate dehydrogenase levels at day 5 and 8. All the trial outcomes were assessed by the site investigators, who were aware of the trial-group assignments.
