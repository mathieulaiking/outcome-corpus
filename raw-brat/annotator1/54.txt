The objective of the pilot stage of the study was a preliminary assessment of the efficacy and safety of AVIFAVIR, and to select the optimal dosing regimen for further evaluation at the pivotal stage (Phase III). The primary efficacy endpoint at the pilot stage was the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 by Day 10 (defined as two negative PCR tests with at least a 24-hour interval). Qualitative Real-Time RT-PCR tests were performed at local laboratories of the clinical sites or in the central laboratory of Rospotrebnadzor.

The study assessments included daily vital signs, SpO2 and WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI); PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs at baseline and on Days 5, 10, and 15; chest computed tomography (CT) scan at baseline and on Day 15; physical examination, complete blood count, biochemistry, C-reactive protein (CRP), urinalysis, and electrocardiogram at baseline and on Days 5 and 15. If not discharged from the hospital earlier, the patients attended follow-up visits on Day 22 and Day 29. All patients were followed until Day 29.

The “go-no-go” decision to start the pivotal stage of the study was based on the exact single-stage Phase II assessment at one-sided α = 0.05 and 80% power [8]. 13/18 (72.2%) or more patients would have been sufficient to demonstrate that the viral clearance in 80% of patients by Day 10 was plausible, and that the response was greater than the presumably noneffective level of 50%. The secondary endpoints that were assessed during the interim analysis were the rate of viral clearance by Day 5, time to normalization of clinical symptoms (ie, body temperature), changes on CT scan by Day 15, and incidence and severity of adverse events related to the study drug.
