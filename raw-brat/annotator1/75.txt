Outcomes
The primary outcome was clinical status, measured at 15 days using a six-level ordinal scale as follows: (1) not admitted to hospital; (2) admitted to hospital and not using supplemental oxygen; (3) admitted to hospital and using supplemental oxygen; (4) admitted to hospital and using non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula; (5) admitted to hospital and on mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygen support; or (6) death. The key secondary outcome was mortality at 29 days after randomisation.
Other secondary outcomes were clinical status assessed by the six-point ordinal scale at 7 days and 29 days; length of hospital stay among survivors; incidence of secondary infection (ie, new infections arising after randomisation, whether nosocomial or not); and number of ventilator-free days by day 29. Safety outcomes were prolongation of the QTc interval (defined as QTc ≥470 ms for women or ≥450 ms for men, in patients whose baseline QTc was below those thresholds, or QTc ≥480 ms if baseline QTc was above those thresholds); gastrointestinal intolerance (meaning diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting); laboratory changes in blood counts and bilirubin levels; acute kidney failure (as reported by site investigators); and overall serious adverse events.
