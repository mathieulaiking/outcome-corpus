R1	DefinedAs Arg1:T1 Arg2:T7	
R2	DefinedAs Arg1:T2 Arg2:T8	
T9	OutcomeDefinition 1087 1834	2-grade increase on an ordinal clinical scale, based on the World Health Organization R&D Blueprint Ordinal Clinical Scale,9 as used in previously published studies,10 within a time frame of 3 weeks after randomization or until hospital discharge (whichever occurred first). The 7-grade ordinal scale consisted of the following levels: 1, ambulatory, normal activities; 2, ambulatory but unable to resume normal activities; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 6, hospitalized, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both; and 7, death.
R3	DefinedAs Arg1:T3 Arg2:T9

T11	SecondaryOutcome 1926 1945	all-cause mortality
T12	TimeFrame 1946 1969	at the end of follow-up
R4	MeasuredAt Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12	
T13	SecondaryOutcome 1979 2079	number, type, severity, and seriousness of total adverse events and treatment-related adverse events
