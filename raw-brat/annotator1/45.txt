 Intervention, primary and secondary endpoints
Patients were randomly assigned via a web-based system at a 1:1 ratio to the current standard of care at each hospital with or without the addition of 300ml of ConvP, the standard volume of one plasma unit produced by Sanquin Blood Supply, was administered intravenously on the day of inclusion. Patients without a clinical response and a persistently positive RT-PCR could receive a second plasma unit after five days. Off-label use of EMA-approved drugs (e.g. chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, anakinra) as a treatment for COVID-19 was allowed in hospitals were this was part of the standard of care. We scored the clinical status with the ordinal 8-point WHO COVID-19 disease severity scale on days 1, 15 and 30. 16 Serum samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at inclusion preceding treatment and thereafter. The primary endpoint of the study was overall mortality until discharge from the hospital or a maximum of 60 days after admission whichever came first.
Key secondary clinical endpoint we describe here are the improvement on the 8-point WHO COVID-19 disease severity scale from inclusion to day 15, hospital length of stay and safety.
