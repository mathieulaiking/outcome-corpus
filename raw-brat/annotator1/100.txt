Outcomes
Outcomes were assessed at 28 days after randomisation, with further analyses specified at 6 months. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were time to discharge from hospital and, among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, post-enrolment use of invasive mechanical ventilation (including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) or death. Prespecified subsidiary clinical outcomes were cause-specific mortality, use of haemodialysis or haemofiltration, major cardiac arrhythmia (recorded in a subset), and receipt and duration of ventilation (for which full data are still being collected from relevant routine sources).
Information on suspected serious adverse reactions was collected in an expedited fashion to comply with regulatory requirements
