 End Points
The primary end point was viral clearance rate at day 7 after randomization. After randomization, respiratory samples were collected every 1–2 days until viral clearance. Viral clearance was defined as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negative on at least 2 consecutive oropharyngeal swabs collected at least 1–2 days apart. Secondary end points included viral clearance at day 3 and day 5, the critical illness rate of subjects during the 14 days after randomization, the mortality rate of subjects at day 14, and the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events.
