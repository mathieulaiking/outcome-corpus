 Outcome measurement
The primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ with respect to time to negative rRT-PCR assessments from randomization up to 14 days. The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the proportion of negative viral rRT-PCR on hospital day 14, the resolution of clinical symptoms (time to clinical recovery), the proportion of discharges by day 14, and the mortality rate. HCQ safety and tolerability were also evaluated.
