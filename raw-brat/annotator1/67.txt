 Outcome
The primary outcome measure was a composite endpoint that included in-hospital all-cause mortality, escalation to ICU admission, or progression of respiratory insufficiency that required non-invasive ventilation (NIV).
The secondary outcomes were the effects on the individual components of the composite endpoint and laboratory biomarkers at baseline and 6 days after inclusion (time window 4-8 days).
