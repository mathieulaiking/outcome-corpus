 Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was a composite measure of progress to severe disease (PaO2/FiO2 ratio <100) any time within 28 days of enrolment or all-cause mortality at 28 days.
Primary outcome was considered as “good” if the progress to severe disease or all-cause mortality could be prevented in the 28 days post enrolment and “poor” if not.
The secondary outcomes were clinical improvement and symptom resolution on day 7; variation in fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2%) on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14; total duration of respiratory support during hospitalization and post enrolment duration of respiratory support till day 28 or discharge whichever is earlier; negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA on days 3 and 7; levels of biomarkers on days 3 and 7 post enrolment compared to baseline; requirement of vasopressor support; and clinical improvement on WHO ordinal scale on day 0,1,3,5,7,14 and 28 days. 22 The WHO ordinal scale was not mentioned in the initial study protocol but was added midway through the trial as it was felt that it will be a key endpoint in any future meta-analysis.
Safety outcomes were frequency of minor and serious adverse event (death and invasive mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic instability) within 6 hours of CP transfusion. Relatedness of a serious adverse event with the trial was assessed as per the definitions given by Edwards and
Aronson.
