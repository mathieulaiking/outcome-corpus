 End points
All AEs, serious and non-serious, were to be reported. Immediately reportable serious adverse events included adverse events that resulted in death and new life-threatening events. The primary outcome was defined as relative change (%) from baseline (day 1 prior to study drug administration at Â± 1h of randomization) in PaO2/FiO2 ratio in supine position at day five. During the study it became clear that several patients in prone position could not be assessed regularly in supine position because of severe hypoxemia. It was therefore decided to focus on all
PaO2/FiO2 ratioassessments (irrespective of position) and perform an analysis of supine position values for sensitivity. Various additional secondary and other outcomes were pre-defined in line with the exploratory nature of the initial phase of the clinical study. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses for patients intubated at or within six hours after randomization was performed.
