 
Outcome Measures

The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement,18 ie, the duration from randomization to the improvement of at least 1 point on a 7-category ordinal scale (adopted from a scale for hospitalized patients with severe influenza)19 or discharge from hospital, whichever occurred first. The 7-category ordinal scale was graded based on the following scheme: 1 for nonhospitalized with normal activities; 2 for nonhospitalized but unable to resume normal activities; 3 for hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4 for hospitalized and requiring supplemental oxygen; 5 for hospitalized and requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 6 for hospitalized and requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, invasive ventilation, or both; and 7 for death.

Secondary outcomes included lymphocyte cell counts on day 5 posttreatment, mortality at day 21, the proportions of patients progressing to critical conditions (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock), and viral loads (reflected by the Ct values as measured with real-time RT-PCR assays) at day 21. Safety outcomes included adverse events, serious adverse events, and premature discontinuation of treatment. Classifications were based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
