Outcome definitions

The primary outcome was the clinical recovery rate at 7 days from the beginning of treatment. Clinical recovery was defined as continuous (>72 hours) recovery of body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and cough relief after treatment, with following quantitative criteria: axillary temperature ≤36.6°C; respiratory frequency ≤24 times/min; Oxygen saturation ≥98% without oxygen inhalation; mild or no cough. Secondary outcomes included the latency to pyrexia relief (for patients with pyrexia at the time of enrollment), the latency to cough relief (for patients with moderate or severe cough at the time of enrollment), the rate of AOT or NMV, all-cause mortality, dyspnea, rate of respiratory failure (defined as SPO2 ≤90% without oxygen inhalation or PaO2/FiO2 <300mmHg, requires oxygen therapy or additional respiratory support), and the rate of patients needed to receive intensive care in ICU. Safety outcomes included adverse events occurred during treatment and premature discontinuation.
