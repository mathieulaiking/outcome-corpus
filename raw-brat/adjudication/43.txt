 Main Outcomes and Measures  Primary end points were (1) maximum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin level; (2) time for C-reactive protein to reach more than 3 times the upper reference limit; and (3) time to deterioration by 2 points on a 7-grade clinical status scale, ranging from able to resume normal activities to death. Secondary end points were (1) the percentage of participants requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) all-cause mortality, and (3) number, type, severity, and seriousness of adverse events. The primary efficacy analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.


End Points

Study end point analysis was planned to be performed in 2 phases, an early biochemical phase and a later clinical phase. The coprimary end points of the biochemical phase were the difference in maximal high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs cTn) levels between the 2 groups and the time for C-reactive protein to reach levels greater than 3 times the upper reference limit. The primary end point of the clinical phase was the time from baseline to clinical deterioration, defined as a 2-grade increase on an ordinal clinical scale, based on the World Health Organization R&D Blueprint Ordinal Clinical Scale,9 as used in previously published studies,10 within a time frame of 3 weeks after randomization or until hospital discharge (whichever occurred first). The 7-grade ordinal scale consisted of the following levels: 1, ambulatory, normal activities; 2, ambulatory but unable to resume normal activities; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 6, hospitalized, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both; and 7, death. Secondary end points were the percentage of participants requiring mechanical ventilation, all-cause mortality at the end of follow-up, and the number, type, severity, and seriousness of total adverse events and treatment-related adverse events.
