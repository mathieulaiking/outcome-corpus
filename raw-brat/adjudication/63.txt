 Outcomes. The primary outcome was the time to clinical improvement (TTCI) as defined by the Cap-China Network 57, which was employed in the LOTUS China trial 11 and recommended by the World Health Organization. TTCI refers to the time from randomization to an improvement of two points on the seven-category ordinal scale as follows 58 (or discharge alive from the hospital): 1, not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities; 2, not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation; 6, hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both; or 7, death. The secondary outcomes were as follows: percentage of patients on seven-category scale on days 7, 14 and 21; time on mechanical ventilation; time of hospitalization of survivors; time on oxygen support; time from randomization to hospital discharge; time from randomization to death; and frequency of severe adverse events as defined by National Cancer Institute Common
