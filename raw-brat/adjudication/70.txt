 Data collection and management

Baseline data, which included demographics, anthropometrics, comorbid conditions, vital signs, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores, were obtained on the day of randomization. Laboratory data, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, PaO2/FiO2, and other treatments used were monitored on days 1, 3, and 7 (day 1 was defined as the day of the first administration of vitamin C).

The primary outcome of the study was IMV- free days in 28 days (IMVFD28). Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, organ functions and inflammatory parameters, including white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts, procalcitonin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multi-organ dysfunction was assessed using SOFA scores.Additionally, vasopressor days, respiratory support days, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)-free days, patient condition improvement rate, patient condition deterioration rate, length of ICU and hospital stay, ICU and in-hospital mortality were recorded as additional secondary outcomes of this research. IMV-free days were defined as the number of days a patient was extubated after recruitment to day 28. If the patient died with MV, a value of zero was assigned. Deterioration of the patient’s condition was defined as the patient requiring HFNC or NIV on day 1 and requiring ECMO or IMV, or dying, after 7 days of treatment. Improvement of the patient’s condition was defined as the patient requiring ECMO or IMV on day 1 and switching to HFNC, NIV, or discharged from the ICU after 7 days of treatment. The P/F was calculated based on the PaO2/FiO2, and we choose the lowest values recorded on the specific day. All the data were collected from the clinical information system of three ICUs.
