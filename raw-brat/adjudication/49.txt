 Outcomes

The primary outcome was the reduction of viral RNA load in nasopharyngeal swabs at days 3 and 7 after treatment start. The secondary outcomes were clinical progression measured using a simplified version of the WHO progression scale [17] (1, not hospitalized with or without resumption of normal activities; 2, hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 3, hospitalized, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation; and 4, death) and time from randomization to complete resolution of symptoms within the 28-day follow-up period. Resolution of symptoms was assessed sequentially using a symptoms questionnaire designed to gather information on the type of symptom and last day experienced; complete resolution was considered when no COVID-19â€“related symptoms were reported at all. Safety outcomes included AEs that occurred during treatment, SAEs, AEs of special interest (ie, cardiac), and premature discontinuation of therapy. AEs were classified according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. All unexpected SAEs were notified through Eudravigilance.
