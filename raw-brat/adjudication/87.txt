A total of 21 mild patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this pilot RCT from February 2020 through March 2020 (Trial Registration: ChiCTR2000029431). Patients were considered eligible in this study on the basis of the WHO interim guidance3 and they were laboratory-confirmed positive on by the means of real-time reverse-transcriptaseâ€“polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Randomization was performed and ensured with the use of Web-based randomization system. Patients were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, into control (11 patients) and 99mTc-MDP group (10 patients). Patients in the control group received routine treatment according to Diagnostic of COVID-19 criteria issued by National Health Commission of China. Patients assigned to the 99mTc-MDP group received a combination of routine treatment and an administration of 99mTc-MDP injection of 5ml/day. Both of the patients in the control and 99mTc-MDP groups were treated for 7 days. The primary end point was the CT-based radiological pulmonary changes from baseline to 7 days. The secondary end points were disease progression from mild to severe on the day 7, as well as radiological pulmonary changes during 7 days to 14 days after treatment.
