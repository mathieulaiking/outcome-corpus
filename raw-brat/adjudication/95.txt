 Outcomes

The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of subjects meeting a severe COVID-19 progression composite end point (death, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, ECMO, and/or vasopressor use) at day 14. The primary safety outcome was the cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and/or discontinuation of therapy at day 30.

Secondary clinical outcomes included changes in an 8-point ordinal COVID-19 clinical severity score (defined in Table 2), the primary composite outcome and mortality at day 30, hospital length of stay (LOS), fever-free days, and oxygen-free days (defined as 7 [the maximum number of days with vital signs captured] minus the number of days with temperature ≥100.4°F or requiring supplemental oxygen). Secondary laboratory outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance on nasopharyngeal PCR, clinically significant changes from baseline to follow-up (day 6, or day 3 if day 6 was unavailable) creatinine [25], hepatic and hematology labs [26], and changes in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, lactic acid dehydrogenase, ferritin, interleukin-6) and coagulation factors (D-dimer) associated with severe COVID-19 [27, 28].
