Outcomes

The primary clinical endpoint was time to clinical improvement within 28 days after randomisation. Clinical improvement was defined as a two-point reduction in patients' admission status on a six-point ordinal scale, or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. The six-point scale was as follows: death=6; hospital admission for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation=5; hospital admission for non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy=4; hospital admission for oxygen therapy (but not requiring high-flow or non-invasive ventilation)=3; hospital admission but not requiring oxygen therapy=2; and discharged or having reached discharge criteria (defined as clinical recovery—ie, normalisation of pyrexia, respiratory rate <24 breaths per minute, saturation of peripheral oxygen >94% on room air, and relief of cough, all maintained for at least 72 h)=1. The six-point scale was modified from the seven-point scale used in our previous COVID-19 lopinavir–ritonavir RCT11 by combining the two outpatient strata into one.

Secondary outcomes were the proportions of patients in each category of the six-point scale at day 7, 14, and 28 after randomisation; all-cause mortality at day 28; frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation; duration of oxygen therapy; duration of hospital admission; and proportion of patients with nosocomial infection. Virological measures included the proportions of patients with viral RNA detected and viral RNA load (measured by quantitative RT-PCR). Safety outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and premature discontinuations of study drug.
