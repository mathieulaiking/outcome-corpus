 Main endpoints
The primary endpoints were clinical parameters, such as the time of need for supplemental oxygen; time of hospitalization; need for admission and length of stay in ICU; and death rate and causes of mortality. As secondary endpoints we assessed clinical and laboratory parameters: measures of serum CRP, serum LDH and relation neutrophil to lymphocyte of peripheral blood samples from day zero to day 7; the number, type, and severity of adverse events; frequency of interruption of the study protocol due to adverse events; and frequency of QT interval above 450 ms.
