Endpoints
 5 days after enrollment or severe adverse reactions appeared was the observation endpoint. Changes in time to clinical recovery (TTCR) and clinical characteristics of patients were evaluated after administration. TTCR is defined as the return of body temperature and cough relief, maintained for more than 72 h. Normalization and mitigation criteria included the following: a. Body temperature ≤ 36.6 °C on the surface, ≤ 37.2 °C under the armpit and mouth or ≤ 37.8 °C in the rectum and tympanic membrane; b. Cough from patients’ reports, slight or no cough was in the asymptomatic range. Body temperature, cough check three times daily to calculate the average level. For radiological changes, the chest CT results in one day before (Day 0) and one day after (Day 6) the study for evaluation. Pulmonary recovery is defined as three levels: exacerbated, unchanged, and improved, moderately improved when less than 50 % of pneumonia were absorbed, and more than 50 % means significantly improved.
