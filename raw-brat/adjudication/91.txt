 Repeat Nasopharyngeal and Throat Swab PCR
All subjects underwent repeat nasopharyngeal and throat swab PCR for SARS-CoV2 every other day until their PCR was negative. These repeat PCR tests began on the fifth day after taking the medication for subjects who began the study and remained symptom-free. The PCR repeat testing began on the second symptom-free day onward for subjects who began the study with symptoms or developed symptoms. The investigators had telephone contact with all the subjects every three days throughout the study to determine any therapy's adverse effects. A re-evaluation PCR was performed after seven days following the first negative PCR.
Endpoints were a negative PCR and resolution of symptoms. The duration from the first day of drug intake to the negative PCR was counted as the recovery period. The duration from the first day of drug intake to the disappearance of symptoms was counted as the period to symptomatic recovery. "Adverse effects" were determined by the existence of the pharmacological side effects of the particular drug during treatment. A detailed history of adverse effects (other than previous disease symptoms) experienced by each participant was collected during the follow-up sample collection. An asymptomatic participant presented with no symptom of COVID-19 and remained the same until the negative PCR
