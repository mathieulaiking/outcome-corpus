 Clinical outcome assessment

The patients were observed for 2â€‰weeks after hUC-MSC infusion, and clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and radiological results were recorded and confirmed by experienced physicians. The primary clinical outcomes included the incidence of progression from severe to critical illness and the time to a clinical improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale that has been used widely in clinical symptom assessment or discharge from the hospital [27]. In our study, the NEWS2 score and seven-category ordinal scale were used to assess the clinical symptoms and conditions of the enrolled patients [28]. The secondary clinical outcomes included patient status at days 7 and 14 assessed with a seven-category ordinal scale, hospital stay, changes in oxygenation index, hematological inflammatory factors, and imaging.
